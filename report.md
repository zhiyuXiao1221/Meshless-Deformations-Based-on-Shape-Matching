### Simulation overview 







### Implementation details

#### 3 different forms of deformations

#### Cluster Deformation



#### Plasticity

#### Interactive Lattice Deformation



#### **Obj Loader** and Model Rendering

We used the a package called tiny_obj_loader to help us load a customized obj.  We also wrote the  vertex and fragment shader to render this bunny mesh. In fragment shader, we implemented the basic Lambert Light model.



### Solved challenges 

Try to use a 

How to properly select a subset vertices need to be animated as particles

Tuned different parameters to achieve a good simulation result
